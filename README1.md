This collaborative short project explores card attrition rates using Jupyter Notebooks for ETL along with BowerBI for visualisation. While not all customers who leave are necessarily churners, attrition data can provide a valuable insight for the trend and further investigation. Credit card churning happens when a person applies for lots of credit cards to collect big sign-up and welcome bonuses. Once they get the sign-up rewards and bonuses, a credit card churner will usually stop using the cards or cancel them, only to repeat the process again.

# Business Requirements:
Banks strive to keep their customers, since a high attrition rate leads to reduced profits. By analyzing trends among customers who leave, banks can take steps to lower attritionâ€”either by modifying their services or shifting their marketing focus to different demographic segments.

## Project Plan
The three of us will collaborate as a Project Manager, Data Architect, and Data Analyst to plan, prepare, and present a data-driven story. We'll extract, transform, and analyze data to build an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The final deliverable will showcase clear insights and effective storytelling through data visualization.

# The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations:
## 1.
## 2.
## 3.

# Analysis techniques used:
Data extraction, cleaning and transformation in Jupyter Notebooks
Visualisation in Power BI: interactive dashboards and visual tools to analyze churn through descriptive stats, correlations, customer segmentation, and churn prediction, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

# Ethical considerations:
Financial data is highly sensitive and must adhere to GDPR and other relevant regulations. To ensure the protection of this information, the data was anonymized by removing client numbers.

# Technologies used:
* VS Code
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Power BI
* AI tools: ChatGPT, Co-Pilot

## Development Roadmap
We have used GitHub and various e-meetings channels to plan, contribute communicate and coordinate our tasks and workload.

# Data Analysis Libraries:
* Pandas- Purpose: Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
* NumPy- Purpose: Numerical operations and array handling.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn- Purpose: Data visualisation to explore relationships between variables.
